The application has a comprohensive test suite. To run the test suite simply
call `make test`.

The `make test` command can also be customised with the following variable overrides:

* `TEST_VERBOSE`: This will print verbose test output: (`TEST_VERBOSE=1 make test`)
* `TEST_COVERAGE`: This will produce a coverae report (`TEST_COVERAGE=1 make test`)

These can also be combined: `TEST_COVERAGE=1 TEST_VERBOSE=1 make test`

## Configuration

By default the application will look for configuration files in the following locations:

* `/etc/{{ cookiecutter.client_name|lower }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_name|lower }}/config.toml`
* `$HOME/.config/{{ cookiecutter.client_name|lower }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_name|lower }}/config.toml`

These configuration files **MUST** be in `toml` format.

Please read more about `toml` here: https://github.com/toml-lang/toml

### Specific Configuration File

You can also provide a specific absolute path to a configuration file via
the CLI `-c` or `--config` flag. For example:

```
{{ cookiecutter.project_name|lower }} -c /path/to/config.toml
```

Please note that if the config file is not found or malformed the application
will fail to start.
