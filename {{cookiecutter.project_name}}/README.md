a `html` generated report which can be viewed in your browser. On OSX you can use the
`open` command:

```
open .cover/cover.html
```

You will also find each individual packages line count coverage file.

## Configuration

By default the application will look for configuration files in the following locations:

* `/etc/{{ cookiecutter.client_name|lower }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_name|lower }}/config.toml`
* `$HOME/.config/{{ cookiecutter.client_name|lower }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_name|lower }}/config.toml`

These configuration files **MUST** be in `toml` format.

Please read more about `toml` here: https://github.com/toml-lang/toml

### Specific Configuration File

You can also provide a specific absolute path to a configuration file via
the CLI `-c` or `--config` flag. For example:

```
{{ cookiecutter.project_name|lower }} -c /path/to/config.toml
```

Please note that if the config file is not found or malformed the application
will fail to start.
